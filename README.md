# Waste2Worth - Bio-Waste Upcycling Platform

Waste2Worth is a web platform designed to connect bio-waste providers with researchers and innovators. The goal is to facilitate the upcycling of waste into valuable biotech resources, promoting a circular economy.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Waste Posting:** Users can post listings of available bio-waste. An AI-powered feature can analyze an uploaded image to automatically suggest a title, type, and description for the listing.
- **Advanced Search:** Find specific bio-waste resources using text search, filters, and a geolocation-based search powered by the Gemini API with Google Maps grounding.
- **Educational Hub:** An "Impact Hub" where users can ask questions about sustainability and bio-waste. Answers are generated by the Gemini API with Google Search grounding, providing up-to-date information with sources.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Educational content can be read aloud using the Gemini Text-to-Speech API.
- **User Profiles:** Simple profile creation and viewing.
- **In-App Chat:** A collaborative chat window, powered by the Gemini API, allows users to connect and discuss potential collaborations.

## üöÄ How to Run Locally

This is a client-side only application built with React and Tailwind CSS, loaded via CDN links in `index.html`. No build step is required.

To run it locally, you just need a simple static file server.

1.  Make sure you have Node.js installed.
2.  Open your terminal in the project's root directory.
3.  Install and run a static server:
    ```bash
    npx serve
    ```
4.  Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided by the server (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

**Note:** For the application to connect to the Gemini API, you will need to deploy it to a hosting provider that supports environment variables (see below).

## üåê Deployment

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Hosting Requirements

This application **cannot be deployed to standard static hosting services like GitHub Pages**.

The reason is that the application's code (`services/geminiService.ts`) is designed to securely access the Gemini API key from an environment variable (`process.env.API_KEY`). Static hosts like GitHub Pages do not provide a mechanism to securely expose environment variables to client-side JavaScript. Attempting to deploy there will result in an "API_KEY environment variable is not set" error, and the app will not function.

### Recommended Hosting Providers

To deploy this application correctly, you must use a hosting provider that supports environment variables for modern web applications. Excellent free options include:

-   **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**
-   **[Netlify](https://netlify.com/)**
-   **[Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting)**

**General Deployment Steps:**

1.  Push your code to a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.
2.  Sign up for an account with one of the providers above and connect your repository.
3.  In the project settings on the hosting provider's dashboard, find the section for "Environment Variables".
4.  Add a new environment variable with the name `API_KEY` and paste your Google Gemini API key as the value.
5.  Trigger a deployment. The hosting service will build and deploy your site, making the `API_KEY` securely available to the application.
